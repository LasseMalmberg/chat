# Client-Server Chat Application

This repository contains the source code for a client-server chat application
developed as part of my Bachelor's thesis titled "Development of a Client-Server
Chat Application". The application was developed with C++ and SDL.

The thesis paper can be found here: <http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:amk-201705107324>.

## Note

The /bin directory contains a precompiled version of the program for
the Windows 10 operating system.

The repository is not updated because the thesis paper depends on
its current state.
